Simple Web Login Automation with Python and Selenium
Overview
This project demonstrates how to automate the login process of a web application using Python and Selenium. It includes a simple HTML login form and a Python script that interacts with the form to perform the login.

Project Structure
index.html: Contains the HTML code for the login form.
style.css: Provides styles for the login form.
script.js: Contains JavaScript code to handle form submission (for demonstration purposes).
automation.py: The Python script that automates the login process using Selenium.
Prerequisites
Before running the Python script, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Selenium library (pip install selenium)
Appropriate WebDriver executable (e.g., Microsoft Edge WebDriver for this project)
Usage
Clone or download the project to your local machine.

Install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install selenium
Download the appropriate WebDriver executable for your browser (e.g., Microsoft Edge WebDriver) and provide the path to it in the automation.py script.

Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python automation.py
The script will automate the login process and display the result on the console.

Customization
Modify the HTML (index.html) to match the structure and elements of your web application's login form.

Update the CSS (style.css) to customize the visual appearance of the login page.

Modify the JavaScript (script.js) to handle form submission according to your application's requirements.

Customize the Python script (automation.py) to interact with your specific web application by locating elements and filling in real login credentials.

Acknowledgments
This project was created as a learning exercise and should not be used for production purposes without further refinement and security enhancements.
